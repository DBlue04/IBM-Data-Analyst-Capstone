# Technology Survey Analysis – Trends in Programming Languages and Databases

## I. Overview:
As part of the IBM Data Analyst Capstone, I led a comprehensive analysis of a modified subset of Stack Overflow survey data to uncover present and future technology trends across various age groups. The project focused on identifying programming language and database trends, while also considering key demographic insights.

## II. Methodology:

**_1. Data Sources:_**

a. Technologies Dataset: Approximately 75,000 survey responses on current and future technology preferences.

b. Demographics Dataset: Around 11,000 responses covering age, gender, education, and country.

**_2. Data Preparation:_**
- Filtered out null values to ensure accuracy.
- No extensive cleaning was required, as the datasets were pre-filtered for the capstone.

**_3. Analysis & Visualization:_**
- Employed the IBM Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE) platform to build interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Created multiple dashboards to compare current usage versus future learning preferences for programming languages, databases, and platforms.

## III. Key Findings & Numerical Outcomes:

**_1. Programming Language Trends:_**
- Current Year: JavaScript and HTML emerged as the most popular languages among developers, with additional significant usage of SQL, PowerShell, and Python.
- Next Year: The same languages remain highly desired for upskilling, suggesting sustained demand.
  
➡️ _Implication: The market may soon see an increased influx of JavaScript and HTML engineers, potentially balancing current supply-demand dynamics._

**_2. Database Trends:_**

- Current Year: MySQL is the dominant database among professionals.
- Next Year: A notable shift is projected, with PostgreSQL and MongoDB gaining popularity—highlighting emerging trends in database management.

➡️ _Implication: Organizations might increasingly adopt PostgreSQL and MongoDB, as MySQL reaches a saturation point._

**_3. Demographic Insights:_**

- 93.5% of respondents were male, with the majority aged between 21 and 43 years.
- Most respondents resided in the USA and India, and a large proportion held bachelor’s or master’s degrees.

➡️ _Implication: The youth-dominated demographic indicates a growing pool of tech talent, which may influence training and recruitment strategies in the technology sector._

## IV. Dashboard & Reporting:
Developed a dynamic, multi-tab IBM Cognos dashboard that provided stakeholders with an at-a-glance view of:
  - Current and future technology trends.
  - Detailed breakdowns of programming language and database preferences.
  - Demographic distribution across key markets.
  - The interactive dashboard enabled real-time exploration of the data, supporting strategic decision-making.

## V. Conclusion:
This capstone project not only honed my technical skills in data extraction, analysis, and visualization but also produced actionable insights into future trends in programming languages and databases. By demonstrating clear, data-driven outcomes—such as the projected shift from MySQL to PostgreSQL and MongoDB and the sustained demand for JavaScript and HTML—this project serves as a powerful portfolio piece that showcases my ability to translate complex datasets into strategic business intelligence. This experience positions me as a strong candidate for intern and entry-level roles in data analysis and technology strategy.
